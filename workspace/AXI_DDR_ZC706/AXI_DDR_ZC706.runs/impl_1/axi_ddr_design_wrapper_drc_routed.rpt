2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net axi_ddr_design_i/ps_to_mig_interface_0/inst/gpio_resp_valid_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin axi_ddr_design_i/ps_to_mig_interface_0/inst/gpio_resp_valid_reg_i_1/O, cell axi_ddr_design_i/ps_to_mig_interface_0/inst/gpio_resp_valid_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net axi_ddr_design_i/ps_to_mig_interface_0/inst/gpio_rvalid_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin axi_ddr_design_i/ps_to_mig_interface_0/inst/gpio_rvalid_reg_i_1/O, cell axi_ddr_design_i/ps_to_mig_interface_0/inst/gpio_rvalid_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net axi_ddr_design_i/ps_to_mig_interface_0/inst/s_axi_arvalid_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin axi_ddr_design_i/ps_to_mig_interface_0/inst/s_axi_arvalid_reg_i_1/O, cell axi_ddr_design_i/ps_to_mig_interface_0/inst/s_axi_arvalid_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net axi_ddr_design_i/ps_to_mig_interface_0/inst/s_axi_awvalid_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin axi_ddr_design_i/ps_to_mig_interface_0/inst/s_axi_awvalid_reg_i_1/O, cell axi_ddr_design_i/ps_to_mig_interface_0/inst/s_axi_awvalid_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-157#1 Warning
Slice clock routing  
For SLICE_X86Y242: more than 2 non-clock pins of the SLICE are driven by different global clocks. This condition should be corrected as it easily becomes congested and will fail to route.
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-23#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and MMCM pair. 
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The MMCM is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. If the IOB is driving multiple MMCMs, all MMCMs must be placed in the same clock region, one clock region above or one clock region below the IOB. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	axi_ddr_design_i/mig_7series_0/u_axi_ddr_design_mig_7series_0_1_mig/u_ddr3_clk_ibuf/diff_input_clk.u_ibufg_sys_clk (IBUFDS.O) is locked to H9
	axi_ddr_design_i/mig_7series_0/u_axi_ddr_design_mig_7series_0_1_mig/u_iodelay_ctrl/clk_ref_mmcm_gen.mmcm_i (MMCME2_ADV.CLKIN1) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on MMCME2_ADV_X0Y0

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal axi_ddr_design_i/mig_7series_0/u_axi_ddr_design_mig_7series_0_1_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the axi_ddr_design_i/mig_7series_0/u_axi_ddr_design_mig_7series_0_1_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of axi_ddr_design_i/mig_7series_0/u_axi_ddr_design_mig_7series_0_1_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
Related violations: <none>
