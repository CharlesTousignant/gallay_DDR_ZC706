REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal design_v3_i/mig_7series_0/u_design_v3_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the design_v3_i/mig_7series_0/u_design_v3_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of design_v3_i/mig_7series_0/u_design_v3_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 design_v3_i/fsm_v3_0/inst/RFIFO/memory_reg has an input control pin design_v3_i/fsm_v3_0/inst/RFIFO/memory_reg/ENARDEN (net: design_v3_i/fsm_v3_0/inst/RFIFO/memory_reg_i_1__0_n_0) which is driven by a register (design_v3_i/mig_7series_0/u_design_v3_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/rstdiv0_sync_r1_reg_rep) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#2 Warning
